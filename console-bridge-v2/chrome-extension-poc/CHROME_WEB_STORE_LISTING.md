## Single Purpose Description (Required by Chrome Web Store)

**Single Purpose:**
Console Bridge serves a single purpose: to stream browser console logs from localhost development servers to the user's terminal via WebSocket connection for development and debugging purposes.

**Justification:**
- The extension captures console events from localhost pages only
- It sends this data to a locally-running CLI tool via WebSocket (port 9223)
- All functionality directly supports this single purpose
- No secondary features or data collection

**Host Permissions Justification:**
- `http://localhost/*` - Required to monitor localhost development servers
- `http://127.0.0.1/*` - Required to monitor 127.0.0.1 (localhost alias)

**DevTools Permission Justification:**
- Required to create Console Bridge panel in Chrome DevTools
- Required to access console API for capturing console events

---

## Version History

**v2.0.0 (Initial Release):**
- Extension mode for monitoring personal Chrome browser
- WebSocket Protocol v1.0.0 implementation
- Multi-tab support
