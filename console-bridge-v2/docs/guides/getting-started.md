## What is Console Bridge?

Console Bridge is a CLI tool that captures browser console logs from your localhost development server and streams them directly to your terminal. It's like having Chrome DevTools console output piped straight to your command line.

**Key Features:**
- 🚀 Real-time console log streaming
- 🎨 Color-coded log levels (log, info, warn, error, debug)
- 📊 Advanced console types (table, group, count, time, trace, etc.)
- 🔄 Auto-reconnection on page refresh/hot reload
- 🌐 Monitor multiple URLs simultaneously
- ⚙️ Configurable output formats

**How it works:**
1. Console Bridge launches a headless Puppeteer browser
2. It navigates to your localhost URL
3. All console output from that page streams to your terminal
4. Listeners automatically re-attach on page navigation/refresh

---

## ✅ v2.0.0 Extension Mode (SOLVED)

**Console Bridge v1.0.0 ONLY (SOLVED IN v2.0.0) monitors the Puppeteer-controlled Chromium browser.**

**What this means:**
- ❌ Cannot monitor your personal Chrome/Firefox/Safari browsers
- ❌ User interactions in your own browser will NOT appear in terminal
- ✅ Must use Puppeteer headful mode (`--no-headless`) to interact and see logs
- ✅ Puppeteer Chromium browser is the ONLY browser being monitored

**Designed for:**
- ✅ CI/CD pipelines and automated testing
- ✅ AI-assisted development workflows
- ✅ Debugging with Puppeteer headful mode (`--no-headless`)

**For full details, see:**
- [REQUIREMENTS.md](../REQUIREMENTS.md) - Complete limitation documentation
- [Headless Implications](../explainer/headless-implications.md) - In-depth explanation

**v2.0.0 adds browser extension support for personal Chrome/Firefox/Safari.**

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16 or higher
- npm or yarn

### Global Installation (Recommended)
```bash
npm install -g @yourorg/console-bridge
```

### Local Project Installation
```bash
npm install --save-dev @yourorg/console-bridge
```

### Verify Installation
```bash
console-bridge --version
```

You should see:
```
1.0.0
```

---

## Basic Usage

### Start Monitoring a URL

```bash
console-bridge start localhost:3000
```

This will:
1. Launch a headless browser
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
3. Start streaming console logs to your terminal

### Monitor Multiple URLs

```bash
console-bridge start localhost:3000 localhost:3001 localhost:4000
```

### Stop Monitoring

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where Console Bridge is running.

---

## Quick Example

### Step 1: Start Your Development Server

```bash
# In terminal 1
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

Your app is now running at `http://localhost:3000`

### Step 2: Start Console Bridge

```bash
# In terminal 2
console-bridge start localhost:3000
```

You'll see:
```
🌉 Console Bridge v1.0.0

Starting monitors...
✓ http://localhost:3000/

Monitoring 1 URL. Press Ctrl+C to stop.
```

### Step 3: Trigger Console Logs

In your app code:
```javascript
console.log('Hello from the browser!');
console.error('This is an error');
console.table([{ name: 'Alice', age: 25 }]);
```

### Step 4: See Output in Terminal

```
[14:32:15] [localhost:3000] log: Hello from the browser!
[14:32:15] [localhost:3000] error: This is an error
[14:32:15] [localhost:3000] table:
┌───────┬─────┐
│ name  │ age │
├───────┼─────┤
│ Alice │ 25  │
└───────┴─────┘
```

---

## Understanding the Output Format

Each log line follows this format:

```
[TIMESTAMP] [SOURCE] LEVEL: MESSAGE
```

**Example:**
```
[14:32:15] [localhost:3000] log: Button clicked!
```

- `[14:32:15]` - Timestamp when the log occurred
- `[localhost:3000]` - Source URL (color-coded per URL)
- `log:` - Log level (log, info, warning, error, debug)
- `Button clicked!` - The actual message

**Color Coding:**
- 🔵 **info** - Blue
- ⚪ **log** - White
- 🟡 **warning** - Yellow
- 🔴 **error** - Red
- ⚫ **debug** - Gray

## Common Workflows

### Unified Terminal Workflow (Recommended)

For the best developer experience, use `concurrently` to run both your dev server and Console Bridge in a **single terminal**:

**Setup:**
```bash
npm install --save-dev concurrently
```

**package.json:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "dev:all": "concurrently \"npm run dev\" \"console-bridge start localhost:3000\""
  }
}
```

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run dev:all
```

**Output (single terminal):**
```
[0] ▲ Next.js 14.0.0
[0] - Local: http://localhost:3000
[1] 🌉 Console Bridge v1.0.0
[1] Monitoring 1 URL...
[0] ○ Compiling /...
[1] [14:32:15] [localhost:3000] log: App loaded!
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Single terminal to monitor everything
- ✅ No context switching between terminals
- ✅ Logs from dev server and browser appear together
- ✅ Cleaner workspace

---

### Traditional Two-Terminal Workflow

Alternatively, run in separate terminals:

**React Development:**
```bash
# Terminal 1
npm run dev

# Terminal 2
console-bridge start localhost:3000
```

**Next.js Projects:**
```bash
# Terminal 1
next dev

# Terminal 2
console-bridge start localhost:3000
```

**Vite Projects:**
```bash
# Terminal 1
npm run dev

# Terminal 2
console-bridge start localhost:5173
```

### Multiple Projects
```bash
console-bridge start localhost:3000 localhost:8080 localhost:4000
```
