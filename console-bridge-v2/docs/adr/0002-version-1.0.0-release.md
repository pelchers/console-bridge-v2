# ADR 0002: Version 1.0.0 Release

**Date:** 2025-10-04
**Status:** Accepted
**Deciders:** Console Bridge Development Team
**Related ADRs:** [0001 - Unified Terminal Output](./0001-unified-terminal-output.md)

---

## Context

Console Bridge has reached a significant milestone with comprehensive console log capture, cross-platform support, and the newly implemented unified terminal output feature. After extensive development and testing, we need to decide whether to release version 1.0.0 as the first stable, production-ready release.

### Current State

**Implemented Features:**
- Full Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) integration
- Support for all 18 console methods (log, info, warn, error, debug, dir, dirxml, table, trace, clear, group, groupCollapsed, groupEnd, assert, profile, profileEnd, count, timeEnd)
- Cross-platform process discovery (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Unified terminal output with `--merge-output` flag
- Graceful fallback when terminal attachment fails
- Comprehensive test coverage (65 unit tests, 90% coverage)
- Framework-agnostic design (works with React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, etc.)

**Documentation:**
- Complete getting started guide
- Advanced usage guide with --merge-output examples
- Comprehensive troubleshooting guide
- Detailed architecture documentation
- Cross-platform testing procedures
- Version-specific documentation (1.0.0.md)

**Testing:**
- ✅ Windows 10/11 tested and passing
- ⏳ macOS testing procedures documented
- ⏳ Linux testing procedures documented
- ✅ Edge case handling validated
- ✅ Integration tests passing

---

## Decision

**We will release Console Bridge version 1.0.0 as the first stable, production-ready version.**

This version includes:
1. Chrome DevTools Protocol integration for comprehensive console capture
2. `--merge-output` flag for unified terminal output
3. Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
4. Comprehensive documentation and guides
5. Extensive test coverage

Version 1.0.0 will be designated as **"Unified Terminal"** codename.

---

## Rationale

### Why Version 1.0.0?

**1. Feature Completeness**

The core functionality is complete and stable:
- ✅ All console methods captured correctly
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility implemented
- ✅ Unified terminal output working as designed
- ✅ Graceful fallback mechanisms in place
- ✅ No known critical bugs

**2. Production-Ready Quality**

Quality indicators meet production standards:
- 90% test coverage on core functionality
- Comprehensive error handling
- Graceful degradation when features fail
- Cross-platform compatibility verified on Windows
- Clear documentation for users and contributors

**3. Semantic Versioning Alignment**

Per [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/):
- Version 1.0.0 defines the public API
- Breaking changes require major version bumps (2.0.0)
- This release establishes the stable API contract

**4. User Value**

The unified terminal feature (ADR 0001) provides significant value:
- Single terminal workflow for development
- Seamless integration with existing dev servers
- Zero-config operation with sensible defaults
- Works with `concurrently` for optimal DX

**5. Documentation Maturity**

Complete documentation suite:
- Getting started guide for new users
- Advanced usage for power users
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Architecture docs for contributors
- Version-specific documentation

### Why Not Wait?

**Arguments against releasing 1.0.0:**
1. macOS and Linux not tested yet (only procedures documented)
2. Some edge cases in test suite (6/7 passing)
3. Console.time() display limitation

**Counter-arguments:**
1. **Platform testing:** Windows fully tested and working. macOS/Linux use standard Unix commands (lsof, ps) which are well-established. Documented procedures enable community testing.
2. **Edge cases:** The failing edge case (Test 1) has an incorrect test expectation, not a code bug. Browser fails to navigate when no server is running, which is expected behavior.
3. **Console.time() limitation:** Documented in Known Limitations. Does not block core functionality.

## Consequences

### Positive

**For Users:**
- ✅ Clear signal that Console Bridge is production-ready
- ✅ Stable API they can depend on
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation for all use cases
- ✅ Official support for unified terminal workflow

**For Development:**
- ✅ Establishes baseline for future features
- ✅ Semantic versioning provides clear upgrade path
- ✅ Version documentation tracks changes over time
- ✅ Community can contribute with confidence

**For Adoption:**
- ✅ 1.0.0 signals stability to potential users
- ✅ npm package demonstrates maturity
- ✅ Clear documentation reduces onboarding friction
- ✅ Cross-platform support increases addressable users

### Negative

**Compatibility Commitments:**
- ⚠️ Breaking changes now require major version bump (2.0.0)
- ⚠️ API stability expected - changes must be backward compatible
- ⚠️ Bug fixes should be patch releases (1.0.x)
- ⚠️ New features should be minor releases (1.x.0)

**Support Expectations:**
- ⚠️ Users expect timely bug fixes for 1.0.x
- ⚠️ Documentation must stay current with releases
- ⚠️ Platform-specific issues need investigation

**Testing Gaps:**
- ⚠️ macOS and Linux need real-world testing (currently documented procedures only)
- ⚠️ Edge case test suite has 1 test with incorrect expectations

### Mitigations

**Platform Testing:**
- Document testing procedures for community validation
- Add CI/CD for automated cross-platform testing (future)
- Accept community PRs for platform-specific fixes

**Edge Cases:**
- Fix incorrect test expectation in test-edge-cases.js (Test 1)
- Continue monitoring for unreported edge cases
- Maintain graceful fallback for all failure scenarios

**Support:**
- Maintain active GitHub issues for bug reports
- Provide clear troubleshooting documentation
- Release patch versions (1.0.x) for critical bugs
- Release minor versions (1.x.0) for new features
