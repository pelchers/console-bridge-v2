# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Browser Console to Terminal Bridge

### Product Overview
A developer-focused npm package that captures browser console output from localhost applications and streams it to the terminal in real-time. This tool bridges the gap between browser development tools and terminal-based workflows, allowing developers to monitor console logs directly in their terminal without switching contexts.

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Front-end developers working on localhost applications
- **Secondary**: Full-stack developers debugging multiple services simultaneously
- **Tertiary**: QA engineers monitoring application logs during testing

### Problem Statement
Developers working with localhost applications need to constantly switch between their code editor/terminal and browser DevTools to monitor console output. This context switching reduces productivity and makes it difficult to maintain focus on the code while debugging.

### Solution
A zero-configuration npm package that:
1. Captures browser console output using Puppeteer and Chrome DevTools Protocol
2. Streams logs to the terminal interface
3. Labels each log with its source URL
4. Provides unified terminal output with dev server logs
5. Requires no browser integration or code changes

### Core Features

#### 1. Zero-Configuration Console Capture
- **Description**: Automatically capture console logs without any browser setup
- **User Story**: As a developer, I want to see console output in my terminal without adding scripts to my app
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - No browser integration required
  - No code modifications needed
  - Works with any localhost URL
  - Automatic Puppeteer browser management

#### 2. Comprehensive Console Method Support
- **Description**: Capture all 18 console methods
- **User Story**: As a developer, I want all console outputs captured automatically
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Support all 18 console methods: log, info, warn, error, debug, dir, dirxml, table, trace, clear, group, groupCollapsed, groupEnd, assert, profile, profileEnd, count, timeEnd
  - Preserve original formatting and data types
  - Handle complex objects and circular references via CDP

#### 3. Unified Terminal Output
- **Description**: Merge browser console logs with dev server output
- **User Story**: As a developer, I want to see both dev server logs and browser console logs in one terminal
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - `--merge-output` flag for unified output
  - Cross-platform process discovery (Windows, macOS, Linux)
  - Graceful fallback when dev server not found
  - Seamless integration without disrupting dev server

#### 4. Terminal Formatting
- **Description**: Color-coded and formatted output for easy reading
- **User Story**: As a developer, I want to quickly identify log types and sources
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Color-code by log type (error=red, warn=yellow, info=blue, etc.)
  - Include timestamps
  - Display source URL prominently
  - Support for light/dark terminal themes

#### 5. Simple CLI Interface
- **Description**: Easy-to-use command line interface
- **User Story**: As a developer, I want to start console capture with a simple command
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - `console-bridge start <url>` - starts console capture
  - `--merge-output` - unified terminal with dev server
  - `--no-headless` - visible browser for debugging
  - `--levels` - filter by log levels
  - `--location` - show file locations
  - Ctrl+C to exit gracefully

#### 6. Multi-URL Support
- **Description**: Monitor multiple localhost apps simultaneously
- **User Story**: As a developer, I want to monitor console output from multiple localhost apps
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Support multiple URLs in single command
  - Independent browser instances per URL
  - Clear source labeling for each URL
  - Maintain chronological order across sources

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- Minimal latency between console call and terminal display (via CDP)
- Low CPU and memory footprint
- Handle high-frequency logging without dropping messages
- Efficient browser lifecycle management

#### Reliability
- Graceful handling of browser crashes
- Automatic browser cleanup on exit
- No data loss during normal operation
- Graceful fallback when terminal attachment fails

#### Compatibility
- Node.js 14.x and above
- Chrome/Chromium via Puppeteer
- Works with all JavaScript frameworks (React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, etc.)
- Cross-platform: Windows, macOS, Linux

#### Security
- Localhost-only operation
- No remote code execution
- No network exposure beyond localhost

### User Experience

#### Installation Flow
1. `npm install -g console-bridge`
2. `console-bridge start localhost:3000`
3. Console output appears in terminal automatically

#### Usage Patterns

**Basic Usage:**
```bash
console-bridge start localhost:3000
```

**Unified Terminal:**
```bash
console-bridge start localhost:3000 --merge-output
```

**Multiple URLs:**
```bash
console-bridge start localhost:3000 localhost:8080
```

**Filtered Output:**
```bash
console-bridge start localhost:3000 --levels error,warn
```

**Visible Browser:**
```bash
console-bridge start localhost:3000 --no-headless
```

### Success Metrics
- Installation count growth
- GitHub stars and community engagement
- Average session duration
- Number of users using --merge-output flag
- Cross-platform adoption rates

### Future Enhancements
1. **Filtering**: Regex-based log filtering in real-time
2. **Search**: Real-time search across captured logs
3. **Export**: Save logs to file with formatting
n### Known Limitations (v1.0.0)

**CRITICAL: Puppeteer Chromium Only**

Console Bridge v1.0.0 ONLY monitors the Puppeteer-controlled Chromium browser:
- ❌ Cannot monitor personal Chrome/Firefox/Safari browsers
- ❌ User interactions in personal browsers will NOT appear in terminal
- ✅ Must use Puppeteer headful mode (`--no-headless`) for manual interaction
- ✅ Designed for CI/CD, automated testing, and AI-assisted development

**See [REQUIREMENTS.md](../docs/REQUIREMENTS.md) for complete limitation documentation.**

**v2.0.0 (planned Q1 2026)** will add browser extension support to monitor personal Chrome/Firefox/Safari browsers.

4. **Remote Debugging**: Support for non-localhost URLs (with security)
5. **Browser Extension**: Alternative capture method
6. **Log Persistence**: Optional database storage
7. **Performance Monitoring**: Capture performance metrics
8. **Network Monitoring**: Capture network requests

### MVP Scope (v1.0.0 - Achieved)
1. ✅ Zero-configuration console capture via Puppeteer + CDP
2. ✅ All 18 console methods supported
3. ✅ Terminal color formatting
4. ✅ CLI interface with multiple flags
5. ✅ Unified terminal output (--merge-output)
6. ✅ Multi-URL support
7. ✅ Cross-platform compatibility
8. ✅ Headless/headful mode

### Constraints
- Must not interfere with existing console functionality
- Should work without modifying application code
- Terminal-only interface for MVP (no GUI)
- Requires Chrome/Chromium via Puppeteer

### Dependencies
- **puppeteer** - Browser automation and CDP access
- **chalk** - Terminal colors
- **commander** - CLI framework
- Minimal external dependencies for reliability

### Architecture
- **Puppeteer + Chrome DevTools Protocol** for console capture
- **Cross-platform process utilities** for dev server discovery
- **BridgeManager** orchestrates browser instances
- **BrowserPool** manages Puppeteer lifecycle
- **LogCapturer** captures console events via CDP
- **LogFormatter** formats logs for terminal
- **TerminalAttacher** merges output with dev server
