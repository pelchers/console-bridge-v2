## Architecture Decisions

### Decision 1: Chrome Web Store vs. Sideloading

**Options:**
1. **Chrome Web Store only:** Official distribution
2. **Sideloading only:** Developer mode installation
3. **Both:** Store + GitHub releases for sideloading

**Chosen:** Both

**Rationale:**
- Chrome Web Store is primary distribution (easier for users)
- Sideloading via GitHub releases for enterprise users with restricted stores
- Beta testing can use sideloading before store approval

**Implementation:**
- Submit to Chrome Web Store
- Also provide `.zip` file in GitHub releases

---

### Decision 2: Documentation Structure

**Options:**
1. **Single README:** Everything in one file
2. **docs/ directory:** Separate docs for each topic
3. **Wiki:** GitHub wiki pages

**Chosen:** docs/ directory with comprehensive README

**Rationale:**
- README gets too long with all details
- docs/ directory is standard practice
- Wiki is harder to version control

**Structure:**
```
docs/
├── extension-mode/
│   ├── installation.md
│   ├── usage.md
│   ├── comparison.md
│   ├── troubleshooting.md
│   └── faq.md
├── migration-v2.md
└── api/ (for future programmatic API docs)
```

---

### Decision 3: Video Hosting

**Options:**
1. **YouTube:** Free, widely accessible
2. **Vimeo:** Professional, ad-free
3. **GitHub:** Embedded in repo
4. **Self-hosted:** Full control

**Chosen:** YouTube

**Rationale:**
- Free and widely accessible
- Good SEO for search queries
- Can embed in README
- Closed captions support

**Implementation:**
- Create Console Bridge YouTube channel
- Upload tutorials
- Embed in README with thumbnails

---

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Chrome Web Store Approval Delays

**Impact:** High
**Probability:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- Submit early (Subtask 3.1)
- Follow all Chrome Web Store policies
- Prepare detailed privacy policy
- Have beta testers use sideloaded extension during review

---

### Risk 2: Beta Testers Find Critical Bugs

**Impact:** High
**Probability:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- Start beta testing early (Week 1)
- Test Phase 2 implementation thoroughly before beta
- Have bug fix time built into schedule (Week 3)
- Prioritize critical bugs over documentation polish

---

### Risk 3: Video Quality Issues

**Impact:** Low
**Probability:** Low

**Mitigation:**
- Script videos before recording
- Use professional screen recording software
- Re-record if quality is poor
- Can defer videos to v2.0.1 if needed

---

## Testing Strategy

### Chrome Web Store Testing
- Test extension installation from store
- Verify all permissions work as expected
- Test update mechanism (future versions)

### Documentation Testing
- Ask non-technical users to follow installation guide
- Verify all code examples work
- Check all links and images

### Video Tutorial Testing
- Show videos to 2-3 beta testers
- Verify all steps are clear
- Ensure video quality is professional

---
