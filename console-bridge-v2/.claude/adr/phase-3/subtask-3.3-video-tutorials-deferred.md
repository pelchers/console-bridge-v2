# ADR: Phase 3, Subtask 3.3 - Video Tutorials (DEFERRED)

**Date:** 2025-10-08
**Status:** Deferred to v2.0.1
**Branch:** `phase-3`
**Depends on:** Phase 3 Subtask 3.2 ✅
**Implementation Time:** Deferred

---

## Executive Summary

Subtask 3.3 (Video Tutorials) is deferred to v2.0.1 release. Video tutorials require manual recording, editing, and YouTube channel setup which are not critical for v2.0.0 MVP release. Written documentation is comprehensive and sufficient for initial release.

**Deferred Work:**
- Installation tutorial video (5-7 mins)
- Usage tutorial video (7-10 mins)
- Troubleshooting tutorial video (5 mins)
- YouTube channel setup
- Video editing and closed captions

**Alternative Provided:**
- ✅ Comprehensive written documentation (docs/USAGE.md)
- ✅ Step-by-step installation guide
- ✅ Usage examples with code snippets
- ✅ Troubleshooting guide
- ✅ FAQ section

---

## Context

### Original Subtask 3.3 Requirements

From Phase 3 preliminary ADR:
1. Script tutorial videos
2. Record installation tutorial (5-7 mins)
3. Record usage tutorial (7-10 mins)
4. Record troubleshooting tutorial (5 mins)
5. Edit videos
6. Upload to YouTube
7. Link from README

### Decision to Defer

**Reasons:**
1. **MVP Scope:** Video tutorials are nice-to-have, not must-have for v2.0.0
2. **Time Investment:** Video production requires 3-4 days (recording, editing, uploading)
3. **Written Docs Sufficient:** docs/USAGE.md provides comprehensive coverage
4. **Manual Work:** Cannot be automated, requires human recording/editing
5. **Can Add Later:** Videos can be added in v2.0.1 without breaking changes
6. **Priority:** Performance testing and migration guide higher priority

---

## Decision: Defer to v2.0.1

**Options:**
1. **Complete now** - Record videos before v2.0.0 release
2. **Defer to v2.0.1** - Release v2.0.0 with written docs only
3. **Skip entirely** - Never create videos

**Chosen:** Option 2 - Defer to v2.0.1

**Rationale:**
- Written documentation covers all video content
- Users can follow written guides successfully
- Videos are enhancement, not requirement
- V2.0.0 can launch without videos
- Community contributors may create videos organically
- Can gauge user demand before investing time

**Outcome:**
- Mark Subtask 3.3 as DEFERRED in Phase 3 tracking
- Document video requirements for future implementation
- Proceed with Subtask 3.4 (Performance Testing)
