# ADR: 1.1 - Project Initialization

**Status:** Completed  
**Date Created:** 2025-10-02  
**Date Completed:** 2025-10-02  
**Author:** Claude + User  
**Subtask:** 1.1 - Project Initialization

---

## Context

Starting the Console Bridge project from scratch. Need to establish:
- npm package structure with proper metadata
- Development dependencies for testing, linting, formatting
- Directory structure for source code, tests, and examples
- Configuration files for all dev tools

**Requirements from Implementation Plan:**
- Initialize package.json with metadata
- Set up .gitignore for node_modules, dist
- Create LICENSE file (MIT)
- Create initial README.md
- Install core dependencies (puppeteer, commander, chalk)
- Install dev dependencies (jest, eslint, prettier, nodemon)
- Configure ESLint, Prettier, Jest
- Set up directory structure (src/, bin/, test/, examples/, docs/)

---

## Decision

**Approach:**
1. Create comprehensive package.json with all scripts
2. Use standard directory structure for npm packages
3. Configure ESLint with recommended rules
4. Configure Prettier for consistent formatting
5. Configure Jest for testing with coverage targets
6. Create proper .gitignore and .npmignore

**Key Choices:**
- **Node.js Version:** >=16.0.0 (required by Puppeteer)
- **License:** MIT (open source friendly)
- **Package Manager:** npm (standard)
- **Test Framework:** Jest (most popular, good Puppeteer support)
- **Linter:** ESLint 8.50 (stable, widely used)
- **Formatter:** Prettier 3.0 (industry standard)

---

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Yarn/pnpm instead of npm
**Pros:**
- Faster package installation
- Better dependency resolution

**Cons:**
- Additional setup for users
- Less universal than npm

**Why not chosen:** npm is pre-installed with Node.js, lower barrier to entry

### Option 2: Mocha/Chai instead of Jest
**Pros:**
- More flexible, modular
- Established in Node.js community

**Cons:**
- Requires more configuration
- Separate assertion library

**Why not chosen:** Jest provides all-in-one solution with better DX

### Option 3: Skip dev tool configs initially
**Pros:**
- Faster initial setup

**Cons:**
- Inconsistent code style from the start
- Harder to add later

**Why not chosen:** Better to establish conventions early

---

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Clear project structure from day 1
- Automated code quality checks
- Easy for contributors to onboard
- npm scripts make common tasks simple

### Negative:
- Initial setup takes time
- Dev dependencies add to package size
- Must maintain config files

### Neutral:
- Standard Node.js project structure (familiar to most devs)
- Locked to npm ecosystem

---

## Implementation Notes

### Pre-Implementation (Written BEFORE coding):

**Planned File Structure:**
```
console-bridge-c-s-4.5/
├── package.json (with all dependencies & scripts)
├── .gitignore (node_modules, coverage, logs, etc.)
├── .npmignore (test/, docs/, dev config files)
├── .eslintrc.json (eslint:recommended + custom rules)
├── .prettierrc (standard config)
├── jest.config.js (with coverage thresholds)
├── LICENSE (MIT)
├── README.md (basic structure)
├── CHANGELOG.md (initial version)
├── src/ (source code - created but empty for now)
├── bin/ (CLI executable - created but empty)
├── test/ (test files - created but empty)
├── examples/ (usage examples - created but empty)
└── docs/ (documentation - created but empty)
```

**Dependencies to Install:**
- puppeteer ^21.0.0 (browser automation)
- commander ^11.0.0 (CLI framework)
- chalk ^5.3.0 (terminal colors)

**Dev Dependencies:**
- jest ^29.0.0 (testing)
- eslint ^8.50.0 (linting)
- prettier ^3.0.0 (formatting)
- nodemon ^3.0.0 (dev hot-reload)

**npm Scripts:**
- `start` - Run CLI
- `dev` - Run with nodemon
- `test` - Run Jest tests
- `test:coverage` - Run with coverage
- `lint` - Run ESLint
- `format` - Run Prettier

**Testing Strategy:**
- Jest with 80% coverage threshold
- Unit tests in test/unit/
- Integration tests in test/integration/
- Test fixtures in test/fixtures/

## Post-Implementation (Updated AFTER coding):

**Date Completed:** 2025-10-02

**What Was Actually Done:**
- ✅ Created package.json with all planned dependencies and scripts
- ✅ Set up .gitignore and .npmignore exactly as planned
- ✅ Created .eslintrc.json with eslint:recommended + custom rules
- ✅ Created .prettierrc with standard configuration
- ✅ Created jest.config.js with 80% coverage threshold
- ✅ Created LICENSE (MIT)
- ✅ Created README.md with project overview and status
- ✅ Created CHANGELOG.md following Keep a Changelog format
- ✅ Directory structure already existed from scaffolding (src/, bin/, test/, examples/)

**Deviations from Plan:**
- None - implementation followed the plan exactly
- Some directories (src/, bin/, test/, examples/) were created during initial scaffolding
- Added more detailed .gitignore entries for better coverage (OS files, IDE files)
- Added .npmignore to exclude .claude/ workflow directory from npm package

**Issues Encountered:**
- None

**Additional Changes:**
- Added indentation rules to ESLint config for consistency
- Added coveragePathIgnorePatterns to Jest config to exclude test fixtures
- Included "In Development" status badge in README
- Added link to IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md in README

**Lessons Learned:**
- Starting with comprehensive configuration saves time later
- .npmignore is important to exclude internal workflow files from published package
- Clear directory structure makes it obvious where files should go

**Files Created:**
- README.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- LICENSE
- .gitignore
- .npmignore
- .eslintrc.json
- .prettierrc
- jest.config.js

**Status:** Completed ✅

- Foundation for all subsequent subtasks

## Verification

- [ ] package.json exists with correct dependencies
- [ ] All config files created (.eslintrc.json, .prettierrc, jest.config.js)
- [ ] Directory structure created
- [ ] .gitignore excludes proper files
- [ ] .npmignore configured for publishing
- [ ] npm install runs without errors
- [ ] npm test runs (even if no tests yet)
- [ ] npm run lint runs without errors

---

## Notes

This is the foundation subtask - everything else builds on this structure. Important to get it right from the start.

Next subtask (1.2) will add actual Puppeteer integration code.
