---

## After Phase B: What Happens Next?

### v2.0.0 Soft Launch (October 2025)
- ‚úÖ Chrome Web Store live (Phase B)
- ‚úÖ GitHub release v2.0.0 published (Phase B)
- ‚è≥ Users start installing and testing
- ‚è≥ User feedback collection begins (GitHub issues)
- ‚è≥ Monitor Chrome Web Store reviews
- ‚è≥ Respond to user questions and bug reports

### v3.0.0 Public Launch (Timeline: 4-8 weeks after v2.0.0)
See `.claude/v3.0.0-IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for full plan:
- **Phase 9:** User Testing & Feedback Collection (2-4 weeks)
- **Phase 10:** Bug Fixes & Improvements (1-3 weeks)
  - Subtask 10.7: Stack trace display configuration (toggle + --verbose)
- **Phase 11:** Public npm Launch & Marketing (1 week)

**Strategy:** Let real Chrome Web Store users validate v2.0.0 before npm launch. Build npm reputation on battle-tested, user-validated product.

---

## Dependencies

**Blocks:**
- v3.0.0 public launch (Phase 9-11)
- npm publish
- Major announcement campaign
- User acquisition marketing

**Requires:**
- ‚úÖ Subtask 2.5 complete (P0 blocker resolved)
- ‚úÖ All v2.0.0 code complete
- ‚úÖ All v2.0.0 documentation complete
- ‚úÖ Extension validation tests passing

**External Dependencies:**
- Google Chrome Web Store review team (5-10 business day turnaround)
- $5 USD developer account fee

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Google Rejects Extension
**Likelihood:** Low (extension follows all guidelines)
**Impact:** High (delays launch by 1-2 weeks)

**Mitigation:**
- Extension already validated with 18/18 automated tests
- Privacy policy and permissions clearly documented
- No malware, no policy violations
- If rejected: Address feedback immediately and resubmit

### Risk 2: Screenshots Not Professional Enough
**Likelihood:** Low (guide provides clear instructions)
**Impact:** Medium (delays submission by 1 day)

**Mitigation:**
- Follow SCREENSHOT_GUIDE.md carefully
- Review screenshots before submission
- Get second opinion if unsure
- Can update screenshots post-submission if needed

### Risk 3: Google Approval Takes Longer Than Expected
**Likelihood:** Medium (Google reviews can vary)
**Impact:** Medium (delays launch by 1-2 weeks)

**Mitigation:**
- Plan for 10-14 day review window (not 5-7 days)
- No critical deadline dependencies
- Can work on v3.0.0 planning during wait
- User doesn't need extension immediately

### Risk 4: Missing Developer Account Access
**Likelihood:** Low (straightforward process)
**Impact:** Low (1 hour delay)

**Mitigation:**
- Create developer account first (Subtask B.3)
- Verify access before starting screenshots
- Have payment method ready
- Contact Google support if issues
