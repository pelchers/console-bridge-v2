# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Browser Console to Terminal Bridge

### Product Overview
A developer-focused npm package that streams browser console output from localhost applications to the terminal in real-time. This tool bridges the gap between browser development tools and terminal-based workflows, allowing developers to monitor multiple applications simultaneously from a single terminal window.

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Front-end developers working on localhost applications
- **Secondary**: Full-stack developers debugging multiple services simultaneously
- **Tertiary**: QA engineers monitoring application logs during testing

### Problem Statement
Developers working with multiple localhost applications often need to switch between browser tabs to monitor console outputs. This context switching reduces productivity and makes it difficult to correlate logs across different applications or services running on different ports.

### Solution
A lightweight npm package that:
1. Captures browser console output using WebSocket connections
2. Streams logs to a unified terminal interface
3. Labels each log with its source (localhost address)
4. Provides easy start/stop controls

### Core Features

#### 1. Multi-Source Log Streaming
- **Description**: Stream console logs from multiple localhost addresses simultaneously
- **User Story**: As a developer, I want to monitor console output from multiple localhost apps in one terminal window
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Support unlimited concurrent connections
  - Each log entry clearly labeled with source URL
  - Maintain chronological order across all sources

#### 2. Console Method Support
- **Description**: Capture all standard console methods
- **User Story**: As a developer, I want all console outputs (log, error, warn, info, debug) to be captured
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Support console.log, console.error, console.warn, console.info, console.debug
  - Preserve original formatting and data types
  - Handle complex objects and circular references

#### 3. Terminal Formatting
- **Description**: Color-coded and formatted output for easy reading
- **User Story**: As a developer, I want to quickly identify log types and sources
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Color-code by log type (error=red, warn=yellow, info=blue, etc.)
  - Include timestamps
  - Display source URL/port prominently
  - Support for light/dark terminal themes

#### 4. Simple CLI Interface
- **Description**: Easy-to-use command line interface
- **User Story**: As a developer, I want to start/stop the bridge with simple commands
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - `console-bridge start` - starts the server
  - `console-bridge stop` - stops the server
  - Ctrl+C twice to exit
  - Clear status messages

#### 5. Browser Integration
- **Description**: Easy integration with any localhost application
- **User Story**: As a developer, I want minimal setup to connect my app
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Single script tag or JavaScript snippet
  - Auto-reconnection on disconnect
  - No interference with existing code
  - Works with all modern browsers

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- Minimal latency (<50ms) between console call and terminal display
- Low CPU and memory footprint
- Handle high-frequency logging without dropping messages

#### Reliability
- Graceful handling of connection drops
- Auto-reconnection capability
- No data loss during reconnection

#### Compatibility
- Node.js 14.x and above
- Support for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Works with all JavaScript frameworks

#### Security
- Only accept connections from localhost
- Optional authentication token
- No execution of arbitrary code

### User Experience

#### Installation Flow
1. `npm install -g console-bridge`
2. `console-bridge start`
3. Add script to HTML: `<script src="http://localhost:9999/bridge.js"></script>`
4. Console output appears in terminal

#### Configuration
- Default port: 9999 (configurable)
- Config file support for persistent settings
- Environment variable overrides

### Success Metrics
- Installation count growth
- GitHub stars and community engagement
- Average session duration
- Number of concurrent connections per session

### Future Enhancements
1. **Filtering**: Regex-based log filtering
2. **Search**: Real-time search across logs
3. **Export**: Save logs to file
4. **Remote Debugging**: Support for non-localhost URLs
5. **Browser Extension**: Alternative to script injection
6. **Log Persistence**: Optional database storage
7. **Web UI**: Browser-based dashboard option

### MVP Scope
For initial release, focus on:
1. Basic multi-source streaming
2. All console methods support
3. Terminal color formatting
4. Simple start/stop commands
5. Basic browser integration script

### Constraints
- Must not interfere with existing console functionality
- Should work without modifying application code (beyond adding script)
- Terminal-only interface for MVP (no GUI)

### Dependencies
- WebSocket library for real-time communication
- Chalk for terminal colors
- Commander for CLI
- Minimal external dependencies for reliability
