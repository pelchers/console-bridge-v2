# ADR (Architecture Decision Record) Conventions
## Console Bridge Development Workflow

## üìã WHAT IS AN ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) documents:
- **What** decision was made
- **Why** it was made
- **What alternatives** were considered
- **What consequences** resulted

---

## üéØ PURPOSE

ADRs help us:
1. **Remember why** we made decisions
2. **Communicate** architectural choices
3. **Onboard** new contributors
4. **Avoid repeating** past mistakes
5. **Track evolution** of the codebase

## üîÑ ADR LIFECYCLE

### 1. Pre-Implementation (BEFORE coding):

**When:** At the start of each subtask, before writing any code

**Create ADR with:**
- Context from Implementation Plan
- Planned decision/approach
- Alternatives considered
- Expected consequences
- Pre-implementation notes

**Status:** `Draft`

**Commit:**
```bash
git add .claude/adr/phase-N/subtask-N.M-name.md
git commit -m "docs(subtask-N.M): create pre-implementation ADR"
```

### 2. During Implementation:

**Update as needed:**
- Add notes about discoveries
- Document unexpected issues
- Record mid-course corrections

**Status:** `Active`

### 3. Post-Implementation (AFTER coding):

**When:** After completing the subtask, before merging

**Update ADR with:**
- Actual implementation details
- What differed from the plan
- Issues encountered and solutions
- Additional changes made beyond original plan
- Lessons learned
- Final consequences

**Status:** `Completed`

**Commit:**
```bash
git add .claude/adr/phase-N/subtask-N.M-name.md
git commit -m "docs(subtask-N.M): update ADR with implementation results"
```

### 4. Superseded (If decision changes later):

**Status:** `Superseded by ADR: [new-adr-name]`

## ‚úÖ ADR CHECKLIST

### Pre-Implementation:
- [ ] ADR file created in correct phase folder
- [ ] Context section explains the problem
- [ ] Decision section outlines planned approach
- [ ] Alternatives section evaluates at least 2 options
- [ ] Consequences section considers trade-offs
- [ ] Pre-implementation notes detail the plan
- [ ] Status set to "Draft"
- [ ] Committed to git

### Post-Implementation:
- [ ] Post-implementation notes added
- [ ] Deviations from plan documented
- [ ] Issues and solutions recorded
- [ ] Additional changes noted
- [ ] Lessons learned captured
- [ ] Status updated to "Completed"
- [ ] Committed to git before merging subtask

## üìä ADR TYPES

### Technical Decisions:
- Technology choices (Puppeteer vs Playwright)
- Architecture patterns (EventEmitter vs Observables)
- Data structures (Map vs Array)
- Algorithm choices

### Design Decisions:
- API design (method names, parameters)
- CLI interface design
- Error handling strategies
- Logging approaches

### Process Decisions:
- Testing strategies
- Development workflows
- Deployment approaches

---

## üéØ WRITING GOOD ADRs

### DO:
‚úÖ Be specific and concrete  
‚úÖ Explain the "why" not just the "what"  
‚úÖ Document alternatives considered  
‚úÖ Include code examples when helpful  
‚úÖ Update ADR after implementation  
‚úÖ Keep it concise but complete  

### DON'T:
‚ùå Leave ADRs as perpetual drafts  
‚ùå Skip the alternatives section  
‚ùå Forget to update post-implementation  
‚ùå Make ADRs too long (>2 pages)  
‚ùå Use jargon without explanation  
‚ùå Skip ADRs for "small" decisions

## üîç EXAMPLE ADR (Abbreviated)

```markdown
# ADR: 1.2 - Basic Puppeteer Integration

**Status:** Completed  
**Date Created:** 2025-10-02  
**Date Completed:** 2025-10-03  
**Subtask:** 1.2 - Basic Puppeteer Integration

## Context

Need to integrate Puppeteer to launch browsers and capture console logs.
Requirements: Headless mode, Chrome/Chromium only, console event capture.

## Decision

Use Puppeteer v21.0 with default configuration plus custom args for stability.
Create BrowserPool class to manage multiple browser instances.

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Playwright
**Pros:** Multi-browser support, modern API
**Cons:** Heavier, unnecessary complexity for localhost-only tool
**Why not:** Over-engineered for our use case

### Option 2: Chrome CDP directly
**Pros:** Lower-level control
**Cons:** Much more code, harder to maintain
**Why not:** Puppeteer provides needed abstraction

## Consequences

**Positive:** Stable, well-documented, active community
**Negative:** Chrome-only (acceptable trade-off)

## Implementation Notes

### Pre-Implementation:
- Planned to use default Puppeteer config
- Expected to need custom viewport

### Post-Implementation:
- Added `--no-sandbox` for Linux compatibility
- Added `--disable-dev-shm-usage` for resource constraints
- Created BrowserPool with instance limit (10)
- Implemented retry logic (not originally planned)

**Deviations:** Added retry logic after discovering browser launch failures in testing.

**Lessons:** Always include fallback/retry for external process launches.

## Verification

- [x] Tests pass (14/14)
- [x] Manual testing on localhost:8080
- [x] Memory usage < 150MB per instance
- [x] Browser launches reliably
```

```

2. **Create ADR:**
```bash
# Create: .claude/adr/phase-1/subtask-1.2-basic-puppeteer-integration.md

```

3. **Commit ADR:**
```bash
git add .claude/adr/phase-1/subtask-1.2-basic-puppeteer-integration.md
git commit -m "docs(subtask-1.2): create pre-implementation ADR for Puppeteer integration"
```

4. **Do the work...**

5. **Update ADR:**
```bash
# Update: Post-implementation section
# Document: What actually happened, deviations, lessons
```

6. **Commit updated ADR:**
```bash
git add .claude/adr/phase-1/subtask-1.2-basic-puppeteer-integration.md
git commit -m "docs(subtask-1.2): update ADR with implementation results and lessons learned"
```
