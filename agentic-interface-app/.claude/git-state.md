- [ ] Release notes generation

---

## Backup Strategy
*To be implemented:*
- Daily automated backups to external storage
- Mirror repository on secondary platform
- Local developer clones serve as distributed backups

---

## Next Steps
1. Initialize git repository
2. Create remote repository on GitHub
3. Configure branch protection rules
4. Set up git hooks
5. Configure CI/CD pipeline
6. Make initial commit
